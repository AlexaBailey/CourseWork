              Potions was described as the art of creating mixtures with magical effects. 
              It required the correct mixing and stirring of ingredients at the right times and temperatures.
               nape's lessons were depicted as unhappy, oppressing times set in a gloomy dungeon in the basement of the castle, whilst Horace Slughorn's,
               who replaced Severus Snape as Potions Master, was shown as more cheerful and even fun at times.</a>

              Matches are played on a large oval pitch with 
              three ring-shaped goals of different heights on each side, between two opposing teams of seven players each: three Chasers, two Beaters, the Keeper, and the Seeker. The Chasers and the Keeper respectively score with and defend the goals against the Quaffle; the two Beaters bat the Bludgers away from their teammates and towards their opponents; and the Seeker locates and catches the Golden Snitch, whose capture 
              simultaneously wins the Seeker's team 150 points and ends the game. 
              The team with the most points at the end wins. </a>

              Presumably taught by Septima Vector in Arithmancy at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, books on the subject included Numerology and Grammatica and New Theory of Numerology.

              In 1995, Harry Potter gifted Hermione Granger a copy of New Theory of Numerology for Christmas. This was something she appreciated, as she had been “wanting it for ages”.
              
              However, Sybill Trelawney was seen teaching Numerology in Divination class instead during the 1989–1990 school year, and claimed this was not Arithmancy, whatever Professor Vector said.

              Astronomy was the only field of study at Hogwarts that had a direct equivalent in the Muggle world. Astronomy classes took place in the Astronomy Tower, the tallest tower in Hogwarts, and were taught by Professor Aurora Sinistra. Lessons involved observations of the night skies with telescopes. Lessons were held every week at midnight, and first years had lessons on Wednesday.

              Known student homework activities included learning the names of stars, constellations and planets, and their locations, movements, and environments.</a>

              Defence Against the Dark Arts, commonly shortened to D.A.D.A., was the class that taught students defensive techniques to defend against the Dark Arts, and to be protected from dark creatures.

              The subject had an extraordinarily high turnover of staff members — throughout Harry Potter's time at Hogwarts, no Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher remained at Hogwarts for more than one school year. These included Quirinus Quirrell, Gilderoy Lockhart, Remus Lupin, Bartemius Crouch Jnr impersonating Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody, Dolores Umbridge, Severus Snape, and Amycus Carrow
